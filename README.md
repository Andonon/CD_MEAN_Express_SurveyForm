Before you start coding this, first outline or write down the steps of accomplishing this.

Have the server render views/index.ejs that has the form for the user to fill out
<ul>
    <li>The user fills out the form and submits</li>
    <li>The submitted form gets sent to /result</li>
    <li>The server recognizes when someone posts things to /result, grabs information from the POST, and sends the POST data back as it renders views/results.ejs</li>
</ul>
